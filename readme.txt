1 About BAPS
===============

BAPS is a collection of programs, utilities, websites, and schemas that assist
URY with day to day broadcasting and presenting activities. BAPS is highly
modular and distict parts of the suite can be run independently. The full suite
does however interoperate seemlessly to provide a fully featured broadcast
platform.



2 Downloading BAPS
=====================

BAPS git repo is located on urybsod, at /home/git/baps3.git



3 Installing BAPS

Prerequisites to building BAPS:
- gcc/clang (4.8+/3.3+ respectively, for C++11)

The use of git is strongly encouraged as only that allows to keep track of
changes.

Once all tools are installed, get a checkout of the repository and you can build
BAPS using cmake. The following targets are available:

Given the usual case that you modify something within BAPS and want to test
that, a simple 'make' should suffice and you can immediately test the changes.
